This project analyzes product return patterns in an e-commerce business to identify why customers return products and how return rates vary across categories, geographies, and marketing channels.
The goal is to reduce return rates by spotting high-risk products and creating a return risk prediction model that can be integrated into business dashboards for decision-making.
TOOLS USED 
SQL :Data cleaning and joins (orders + returns).
Python (pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib) : Data preprocessing, EDA, predictive modeling.
Power BI : Interactive dashboard with KPIs, slicers, drill-through filters.
